# CS230
CS 230 Final Project

One issue is that data records are sparse a long time ago. ie- Daily data is not available. 
I think daily data is very important; monthly is not going to be of much use to us. 

VIX (Starts 1986)



Data:
DOW Jones (Daily data starts in ~1890 'awesome!')
GOLD (Daily starts in late 1933) - Actually, this doesn't make sense until after 1971, 
since the US dollar was tied to gold, and hence it's not like people could "flock" to gold when they were
worried, as they do today. 
S&P 500 (Daily starts in 1988)
US 10-YR Yield (Daily starts in 1962)

Other:
GFD_TBILL_Daily (Daily data starts in late 1800s) - TRUSABID - Daily total return bond index
